# One day, client schema will be persisted in local storage.
# Not sure yet what is the best design pattern regarding nullability.
# The thing is, what will happen when we remove draftText with its handler?
# A new app will get the old local storage.
# I suppose a new app will not use the old field at all.
# So, it seems using non-null type is both fine and convenient for DX.
# Non-null values are ensured in createRelayEnvironment handlerProvider.
